# Comparing the data quality and accuracy

In order to assess the reliability of the data from DWD, they have been contrasted with the information provided by [meteoblue.com](https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/munich_germany_2867714). 

In particular, the graphs of *wind speed per month* and *wind rose* have been created in a similar format that Meteolbue presents them. 

## Wind speed per month
Meteoblue:

DWD:

While the figures created with both sources look very similar overall, a difference can be noticed in that Meteoblue records higher values for wind speed.

This could be due to the fact that the measurement locations might be different, as well as the corrections used to standarize the data.

## Wind rose

Regarding the wind rose, the level of similarity of both figures is quite acceptable.

Since the precision of wind direction from the DWD data is 10 degrees, creating a 16-direction wind rose like that of Meteoblue would have resulted in an inaccurate graph.
